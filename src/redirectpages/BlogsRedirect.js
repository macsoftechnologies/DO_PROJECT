                  Data’s exponential growth: Data has been experiencing
                  exponential growth, with IBM reporting that approximately 90%
                  of the world’s data has been generated in just the last two
                  years. This rapid expansion in data volume presents a
                  challenge for conventional data engineering methods. Gen AI,
                  however, holds the potential to address this challenge by
                  automating data processing tasks and extracting valuable
                  insights from the vast amounts of data.
